# Very-Very-Very-simple-implementation-of-Hill-Climbing-Algo

## A very simple implementation of hill climbing algorithm to predict matching words.

 hill climbing is a mathematical optimization technique which belongs to the family of local search. It is an iterative algorithm that starts with an arbitrary solution to a problem, then attempts to find a better solution by making an incremental change to the solution. If the change produces a better solution, another incremental change is made to the new solution, and so on until no further improvements can be found.
